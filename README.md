# FamilyGuard: The Missing Link in Fraud Prevention

> **“Most security apps stop at the first line of defense but FamilyGuard intervenes during the attack.”**

---

## Overview

**FamilyGuard** is a family-centric fraud prevention platform designed to protect vulnerable users—especially the elderly—from modern digital scams such as call-center fraud, phishing messages, and coerced financial transactions.

Developed for the **Samsung × KBTG Digital Fraud & Cybersecurity Hackathon**, FamilyGuard addresses a critical gap left by traditional security solutions: **social engineering attacks that succeed after the first line of defense fails**.

## The Core Problem

### The Failure of the “First Line of Defense”

Conventional security applications focus on:

- Spam call blocking  
- SMS and URL filtering  
- Scam number blacklists  

These methods are increasingly ineffective. Scammers rotate numbers, spoof identities, and rely on **psychological manipulation** rather than technical exploits.

Once a victim answers a call or follows instructions, most security tools become irrelevant.

## The Paradigm Shift: Second-Line Protection

**FamilyGuard intervenes during the attack, not before or after.**

The system protects the **Second Line of Defense** by combining:

> **Real-time behavioral analysis × AI intelligence × Human (family) intervention**

---

## How FamilyGuard Works

FamilyGuard remains passive until high-risk behavior is detected, then escalates progressively.

---

### 1. Behavioral Detection 

Using Android **Accessibility Service**, FamilyGuard monitors on-device behavior instead of static blacklists.

- Banking or payment apps opened during long phone calls  
- High-pressure scam keywords such as “Transfer immediately” or “Police”

---

### 2. Generative AI Analysis 

Suspicious context is securely transmitted to the AI engine.

- Detects urgency fabrication  
- Detects authority impersonation  

**Output:** Risk Score (0–100%)

---

### 3. Family Intervention — *The Human Firewall*

- Instant push notifications to guardians  
- High-risk actions require guardian approval  

---

## Technology Stack

- Android: Kotlin + Jetpack Compose  
- Backend: Node.js + Express
